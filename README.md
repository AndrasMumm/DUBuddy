# DUBuddy
An Industry profit calculator for the Dual Universe Beta.\
This is currently not a feature complete Industry calculator.\
While the algorithms themselves are done there is currently no exposed API that would allow live tracking of marketplace data.\
Currently one needs to manually adjust the realistic price range of the items in the source code.\
Additionally not all items are currently implemented.\
Until a public API that exposes the needed data is provided, I decided to freeze this project, however decided to release the source code early.

# How to compile
Just load the .sln file with any recent Visual Studio and compile away!

# How to use
After compiling, execute the resulting DUBuddy.exe file in DUBuddy/DUBuddy/bin/[Release/Debug].
Then just enter the wanted end products and how many machines you want to produce it with in the top left "Wanted end results" table and press "Calculate".
